      <h1>About Sladesoft:</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left">Sladesoft will serve multiple purposes; personal project, a thought tracker, and a place to manage my projects. This is a personal project for me as I complete my studies at Millersville University. I have decided to create a personal webpage to improve my web development skills. The blog will be used as a platform for visitors to examine and learn about my thought process as I write programs and compete other projects. I will also be using Sladesoft to maintain any major projects I release in the future.</p>

      <h1>About Me:</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left">My name is Robert Slade. I am a senior Computer Science major at Millersville University, graduating in Fall 2019. While being mostly proficient in Kotlin, I use C++ for my personal projects. Additionally, most of my professional experience has been in backend and mobile software development. However, as I graduate and grow professionally I plan on expanding my experience to other areas.</p>
