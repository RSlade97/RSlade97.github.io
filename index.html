    <p>
      I graduated from Millersville University in December 2019 with a bachelor's in computer science. I interned twice
      as a full-stack software engineer working on an enterprise scale web application helping industrial contractors go
      paperless. I am now working as a site reliability engineer supporting some of the United States' most well-known
      grocery retailers.
